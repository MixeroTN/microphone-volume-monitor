# Running Microphone Monitor Completely Hidden

## Problem Solved

The issue where running `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1" -Verbose` would show a terminal window that closes the monitor when closed has been **resolved**.

## New Hidden Execution Method

### Quick Start (Completely Hidden)

Run this command and **the terminal window will close automatically**:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1"
```

**What happens:**
1. The script detects it's running in a visible terminal
2. It automatically restarts itself in completely hidden mode  
3. The original terminal window can be closed safely
4. The monitor continues running in the background

### Usage Examples

#### Start Monitor (Completely Hidden)
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1"
```
**Result**: Monitor starts hidden, a terminal window closes safely

#### Check Monitor Status
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1" -ShowStatus
```
**Result**: Shows current status, recent log entries, and PID

#### Force Silent Mode (Expert)
```powershell
powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1" -Silent
```
**Result**: Completely silent startup with no output

### Key Features

✅ **Auto-Hidden Mode**: Automatically restarts in hidden mode if run from visible terminal  
✅ **No Terminal Dependency**: Monitor runs independently after startup  
✅ **Status Checking**: Use -ShowStatus to check if monitor is running  
✅ **Safe Window Closing**: Original terminal can be closed without affecting monitor  
✅ **Process Detachment**: Monitor fully detaches from a parent process  

### How It Works

1. **Detection**: Script detects if running in visible terminal
2. **Auto-Restart**: Automatically launches a hidden version of itself
3. **Process Detachment**: Uses `System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo` with `CreateNoWindow = true`
4. **Independent Execution**: Monitor runs completely independent of the original terminal

### Verification Commands

#### Check if Monitor is Running
```powershell
Get-Process powershell | Where-Object { $_.WorkingSet -gt 50MB }
```

#### View Live Logs
```powershell
Get-Content "$env:TEMP\MicrophoneVolumeMonitor.log" -Wait -Tail 10
```

#### Stop Monitor
```powershell
Stop-Process -Id [PID_NUMBER]
```
*Replace [PID_NUMBER] with actual PID from the status check*

### Migration from Old Method

**Old method (terminal stays open):**
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1" -Verbose
# Terminal window would stay open and closing it would kill monitor
```

**New method (completely hidden):**
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1"
# Terminal window closes automatically, monitor continues running
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Monitor Not Starting
```powershell
# Check status
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "run-background.ps1" -ShowStatus
```

#### Multiple Instances
The script automatically stops existing monitor processes before starting new ones.

#### Can't Find Process
Use the status check command to get the current PID and verify the monitor is running.

## Summary

The microphone volume monitor now supports **truly hidden background execution**. Users can start it with a simple command, close the terminal window immediately, and the monitor will continue running independently in the background. This resolves the issue where closing the terminal would terminate the monitoring process.
